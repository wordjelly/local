Inventory Architecture:

1. Item type -> for eg: Serum Seperator Tube 5 ml.
2. Item -> Usually Individual
3. Incoming package -> consists of items bundled together.
4. Item Order -> 
5. Kits/Reagents
6. Suppliers
7. Item Requirement, and statuses -> which have their own item requirement definitions, and how exactly is this currently working out.
