29/4/2019:
1. date of birth selection UI not working with profiles_edit.
2. adding organization id , and verified as true for the creator of the organization itself.
3. add views and controller for packages, with versioning.
4. you can only add an item to a transaction if that transaction is showing that some items were received.
5. you cannot add an item to it, if items exceeding the received amount have already been registered on it.
6. index call does not query for public items if there is a current user.
7. vulnerability in the omniauth-ruby gem / what to do about this ? post/get request ?

PART A
7. add item requirements -> autocomplete inside the autogenerated form partial.
8. collate item requirements for multiple reports -> add or remove reports and update the item requirements.
9. assign local item group -> to bunch of reports.
10. verify a report -> (multiple verifications, direct data entry.)
11. handling inputs from outsourced reports, and the flow of smaple entry at the outsourcing points.
12. generate a report pdf.
13. handling interoperability between consultant, patient and lab for report visitibilty. connection patient and user.

## so the item requirements are added as an array
## requirements is an array of categories.
## finally the resolution is done at the level of the requirement.
## so inside requirement we nest
## {
	category : 
	item_id :
	item_group :
	whatever.
} 


PART B :
1. collation of statuses 
2. scheduling of statuses and routines, cancellation, postponement, and linking inventory to routines inside statuses.

PART C :
1. inventory updates by means of actions, and disposal and recycling of inventory items.
2. 


# so first change the architecture of test to ensure that it needs to be have the normal range ids added to it directly.
# for that give a search box.
# for name id -> ensure organization 

create reports,
make tests,
make normal ranges, } 1 hour (by 1 pm.)
## so now comes the versioned concern.
## 

make packages, } 1 hour (by 3 pm) - done, 

in the report -> a nested object for rates for each organization that can be customized.

what is next?
--- organization -> enforce the presence of some roles
--- user joining organization -> enforce it to have a role
--- versioned concern, ensure that verification is by the required number of users of those roles
--- tests, reports, normal_ranges

clone/customize reporst/tests/ranges } 1 hour (by 2 pm.)

reports :
-- image,
-- nested object for customization of rates.
-- sit in doctors rooms.


require an image to be compulsory for a report, } 15 mins

generate a pdf of an individual report, 
generate a pdf of a given group of reports, 
generate a pdf of abnormal findings, 
with final letterhead and formatting of the issuing organization, making sure everything looks good.
=> 1.5 hours } 5 pm.

generate a chart of the report values over time } 1 hour : 6 pm.

finalize how to enter values of a report manually, 

have a doctor's signature for the report, 
or more than one, 

cross checking values module for report entry/with challenges about patient information.

item groups, items , item_requirements, status definition.

-- imagine a utopian system where i finish all this in one day --
and from tomorrow how to only deal with bookings and schedules part.

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. transfers can be done for any transaction or item, or item group by any party.
2. a party from another organization cannot transfer from the primary organization to himself.
3. item is utilized when assigned to a patient, or marked as utilized.
4. item has to be detached from an existing item group before being reattached to another item group.
5. CRUD pages for comment, item_type, item_transfer and transaction, let me start with controllers for these also, at this stage.
6. basic def to calculate depleted stock.
7. how to deal with combi kits (how to barcode individual items?)
8. generating a written code for transaction items, so that we don't have to stick barcodes on them, or can we ?
9. how to solve date of opening of bottles (item modification)
10. automatic setting of routines to check stocks of items assigned to individual members/persons, should be able to sort this in one day.

----------------------------------------------------------------
pre populated tag types:

1. do we have kits ?
2. that should come from item groups.
3. so there we autocomplete on item groups.

-----

Steps to give users multiple organizations:
-------------------------------------------

1. update form : done
2. update organization to consider the members, while opting for the verified or rejected : doing.
3. if member organization is deleted, it should be removed from the list of verified users in the parent organization.
4. add organization header, and relevant organization selection to the base_controller_concern.
5. add functionality to become a member of a higher organization
6. add functionality for cascading.
7. after all this is done, we move forwards.

-- let me get all thsi out of theay

this will take till night. 
then we move to report test normal range.
or i can do that first also.
upto me.


## so order -> package/report -> add/remove later -> assign tubes -> schedule -> report format -> notify
## payment seperate 
## routine we go for, from monday onwards
